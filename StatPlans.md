# DAMAGE TYPES 

## PHYSICAL

    There are three different damage types: Slash, Pierce and Blunt.

    These damage types deal damage against their respective defenses: Slash Defense, Pierce Defense and Blunt Defense.

    In light armours, slash and pierce resistances are relatively low, but blunt resistance is high.
    In heavy armours the stats are flipped.

    This means that:
    Slash beats light armour
    Heavy Armour beats slash
    Blunt beats heavy armour
    Light Armour beats blunt
    Pierce is ok against both
