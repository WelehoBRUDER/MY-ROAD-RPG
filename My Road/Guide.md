# WELCOME TO MY ROAD!

## Getting started

### Character Creation 

Character creation consists of three phases, choosing a name, choosing a class, and appointing stat and skill points.

1. Name  
Your character's name is purely visual and will not affect gameplay. It will show up everytime you perform an action.

2. Class  
Your class will determine your starting abilities, spells and stats. Here is a brief breakdown of each class:
- `Rogue`: Purely DPS. Rogues have a very high crit chance, prefer dualwielding daggers and use poison. Rogues are squishy but excellent for dealing massive damage.
- `Warrior`: Warriors are a mix between a tank and a dps. Warriors have high HP, wear heavy armour and can choose between two handed weapons or a shield and weapon.
- `Hunter`: Hunters are squishy but agile, having the highest cap for dodging out of all classes. They use bows to deal accurate pierce damage.
- `Mage`: Mages are spell casters. Mages use light, dark and healing spells to crush their foes. Starting as a mage is difficult due to limited maximum mana, so be careful!

3. Stats

You get 8 stat points and 4 skill points at the beginning of the game. 
Your basic stats are:  
        - `STR`: **Strength** increases damage from **strength** scaling weapons and allows further upgrades to skills related to it.  
        - `DEX`: **Dexterity** increases damage from **dexterity** scaling weapons and allows further upgrades to skills related to it. Also improves spell damage slightly.  
         - `VIT`: **Vitality** increases maximum **hit points** by 50 per level and allows further upgrades to skills related to it.  
        - `END`: **Endurance** increases maximum **stamina** by 25 per level and allows further upgrades to skills related to it. Also improves spell damage.

-   Rogues prefer `DEX`.
-   Warriors prefer ``STR`` and ``VIT``.
-   Hunters prefer ``DEX`` and ``END``.
-   Mages prefer ``DEX`` and ``END``, but benefit from ``VIT`` as well.
